                        The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire youth to practice the
                        ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator
                        or referee whose behavior detracts from this purpose is subject to disciplinary action
                        regardless of technical soccer background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.

                        competition program that are unable to provide a field that meets these minimum requirements
                        must advise the State Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the
                        field and recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be
                        granted. Teams from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable
                        field may be required to play all their games away.
